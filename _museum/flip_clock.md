### Flip clock

Electro-mechanical flip clocks are one of those "retro" electronic items that are sold on Etsy and there are even modern reproductions.  Although electro-mechanical "digital" clocks were first seen in the 1930s in public places they only became a domestic item in the 1970s, and progressed quickly through that decade from clocks with numbers on wheels through flip clocks to a few "solid state" clocks using nixie tubes, and then very many using seven segment LED displays. In most cases these digital clocks were alarm clocks on a bedside table.
