### MSP430 LED alarm clock

This is a project that I've actually completed.  It was an exercise I set myself to learn to program the low cost, and very low power, TI MSP430 microcontroller.

The challenge I set myself was to build a digital alarm clock using only a basic MSP430 and a 4 digit 7 segment display and some push buttons.
