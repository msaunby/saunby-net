### Background and inspiration

This is a session proposed for Mozilla Festival 2016, October, London. 
[Mozilla Festival, London](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mozfest/2016)


### Description

Toys began as homemade things, often made by children themselves to designs passed down through generations. The growth of the maker community, the capacity of the Internet to share ideas and the delight of a successful make, 3D printing, and more, should enable a resurgence of delightful, quirky, cheap, amazing, personal, empowering, life changing TOYS! Let's make some!

### Agenda

We'll make toys. There will be stuff to make toys from. There will be homemade toys to copy and evolve. There will be other people to play with. Youths might also get a chance to join in if there's space.
Participants

This will work with 1 to 30. More than that and we'll run extra sessions.

### Outcome

Lots of amazing toys. Internet of Toys!
